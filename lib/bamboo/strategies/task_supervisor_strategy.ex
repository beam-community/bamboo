  @moduledoc """
  Default strategy. Sends an email in the background using Task.Supervisor

  This is the default strategy when calling `deliver_later` because it is the
  simplest to get started with. This strategy uses a `Task.Supervisor` to monitor
  the delivery. Deliveries that fail will raise, but will not be retried, and
  will not bring down the calling process.

  ## Why use it?

  Sending emails can often take time and may fail. If you are sending email
  during a web request (for instance, sending a welcome email), you probably
  don't want to make your users wait the extra time for the welcome email to send.
  Instead you can use `deliver_later/1` and it will be delivered in the background
  so web requests remain snappy.
