  Helpers for testing email delivery

  Use these helpers with Bamboo.TestAdapter to test email delivery. Typically
  you'll want to **unit test emails first**. Then in integration tests use
  helpers from this module to test whether that email was delivered.

  ## Note on sending from other processes

  If you are sending emails from another process (for example, from inside a
  Task or GenServer) you may need to use shared mode when using
  `Bamboo.Test`. See the docs `__using__/1` for an example.

  For most scenarios you will not need shared mode.

  ## In your config

      # Typically in config/test.exs
      config :my_app, MyApp.Mailer,
        adapter: Bamboo.TestAdapter

  ## Unit test

  You don't need any special functions to unit test emails.

      defmodule MyApp.EmailsTest do
        use ExUnit.Case

        test "welcome email" do
          user = %User{name: "John", email: "person@example.com"}

          email = MyApp.Email.welcome_email(user)

          assert email.to == user
          assert email.subject == "This is your welcome email"
          assert email.html_body =~ "Welcome to the app"
        end
      end

  ## Integration test

      defmodule MyApp.Email do
        import Bamboo.Email

        def welcome_email(user) do
          new_email(
            from: "me@app.com",
            to: user,
            subject: "Welcome!",
            text_body: "Welcome to the app",
            html_body: "<strong>Welcome to the app</strong>"
          )
        end
      end

      defmodule MyApp.EmailDeliveryTest do
        use ExUnit.Case
        use Bamboo.Test

        test "sends welcome email" do
          user = %User{...}
          email = MyApp.Email.welcome_email(user)

          email |> MyApp.Mailer.deliver_now

          # Works with deliver_now and deliver_later

  Imports Bamboo.Test and Bamboo.Formatter.format_email_address/2

  `Bamboo.Test` and the `Bamboo.TestAdapter` work by sending a message to the
  current process when an email is delivered. The process mailbox is then
  checked when using the assertion helpers like `assert_delivered_email/1`.

  Sometimes emails don't show up when asserting because you may deliver an email
  from a _different_ process than the test process. When that happens, turn on
  shared mode. This will tell `Bamboo.TestAdapter` to always send to the test process.
  This means that you cannot use shared mode with async tests.

  ## Try to use this version first

      use Bamboo.Test

  ## And if you are delivering from another process, set `shared: true`

      use Bamboo.Test, shared: true

  Common scenarios for delivering mail from a different process are when you
  send from inside of a Task, GenServer, or are running acceptance tests with a
  headless browser like phantomjs.

            1) Set your test to [async: false].
            2) If you are delivering emails from another process (for example,
               delivering from within Task.async or Process.spawn), try using
               Mailer.deliver_later. If you use Mailer.deliver_later without
               spawning another process you can use Bamboo.Test with [async:
               true] and without the shared mode.
            3) If you are writing an acceptance test that requires shared mode,
               try using a controller test instead. Then see if the test works
               without shared mode.
